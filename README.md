# git-practice
A repository for students to practice using Git/Github

Instructions for students:
1. Fork the repository into your own github account.
2. Remove the erroneous commit `0dbea28`. It was a mistake! It shouldn't appear in history anymore. *Hint: rebase --interactive*
3. Remove the file `delete.me` from the repo
4. Make a file called `todo.txt`, add some tasks into it, and commit it.
5. Rebase your master branch onto matt-chan-branch-1.
6. Add more tasks to `todo.txt` and commit those too.
7. Go back to the original `todo.txt` and make a new branch called `planB`. Add some tasks to the file and make a commit.
8. Merge the two branches back together. Fix any merge conflicts.
9. Make a pull request against my master branch.
